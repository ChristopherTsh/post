                    <p class="mb-md-5 mb-4">Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, and loss of joy. It is different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life.

                      Major life events, such as bereavement or the loss of a job, can triggerTrusted Source depression. But depression is distinct from the negative feelings a person may temporarily have in response to a difficult life event.
                      
                      Depression often persists in spite of a change of circumstances and causes feelings that are intense, chronic, and not proportional to a personâ€™s circumstances.
                      
                      It is an ongoing problem, not a passing one. While there are different types of depression, the most common one is major depressive disorder. It consists of episodes during which the symptoms last for at least two weeks.Trusted Source
                      
                      Depression can last for several weeks, months, or years. For many people, it is a chronic illness that gets better and then relapses.</a>
